It ensures that the method correctly returns a list of sides associated with the specified main dish. | Create a Main instance with the ID mainDishId and name "Main Dish." |  | The test should pass if all assertions are true and there are no exceptions during the test execution. This would indicate that the getAllSides method correctly retrieves and returns the list of sides associated with the specified main dish. |
